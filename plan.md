## What we have
    So most of the basic things are done so far. We have a class that can modify a URL and scrape through every single show title that is on each of these pages.
    > What I plan to do next is gather more information about each of these show titles. Maybe brief synopsis and genre. I will also have to go through each of the links associated with the tiles and find all episodes
